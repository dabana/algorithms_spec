This repository contains all the code I have written so far for the programming assignments in the Algorithms Specialization by Tim Roughgarden of Standford University on Coursera.

Course 2 assignement 1: Kosaraju two-pass depth first search (DFS) algorithm implementated using recursion

Course 2 assignement 2: Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm implemented using a heap data-structure from [Daniel Stutzbach](https://github.com/DanielStutzbach/heapdict).

Course 2 assignement 3: Median maintenance using two heaps. Implemented with the heapq python class.

Course 2 assignement 4: Algorithm to solve the 2SUM problem with many targets and large dataset. Implemented a O(nlog(n)) solution making use of the sparness of the problem instead of the O(nt) default solution, where t is the number of target.
