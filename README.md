This repository contains all the code I have written so far for the programming assignments in the Algorithms Specialization by Tim Roughgarden of Standford University on Coursera.

Course 2 assignement 1: Kosaraju two-pass depth first search (DFS) algorithm implementated using recursion

Course 2 assignement 2: Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm implemented using a heap data-structure for Daniel Stutzbach[https://github.com/DanielStutzbach/heapdict].
